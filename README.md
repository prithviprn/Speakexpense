Touch is a great feature of phones, tablets and even desktops. But, voice is an even greater feature, because, unlike touch, you don't 
have to look at your device or even hold it when you speak to it. With more and more people speaking to their devices, voice recognition 
is getting better each day!
Speak Expense is designed to be intuitive and easy to use. It is primarily a voice-based app with touch as a fall back feature. It 
interacts with you using voice. With Speak Expense, you can

1.Enter your expenses in the database on your phone by speaking to it
2.Track your expenses on a daily, monthly and yearly basis
3.Track your expenses by store name
4.Add, Delete and Update your expenses using voice commands
5.Generate bar chart,line chart and pie chart of your expenses
6.Export your expenses from the database to a csv file
7.Automatically transfer the csv file to your desktop or tablet using Bluetooth by just pressing a button (called share)

At each step, the app echos what you said and asks for confirmation and it simultaneously displays what you spoke as text in a textbox. 
You can either say yes or ask it to repeat the step using voice or make a correction using touch. When you save the text or confirm by 
voice that everything is correct, it gets broken down into name of the store, name of the product,place and price and gets stored in the 
database on your phone along with current date and time. You can export this data to any other device in the form of a csv file using 
Bluetooth at any time.

The current version of Speak Expense is intended for tracking personal expenses.
